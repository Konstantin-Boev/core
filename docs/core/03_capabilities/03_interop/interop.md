## Interop

The [Interop API](../../../reference/core/latest/interop/index.html) enables applications to:

- **offer functionality** to other applications by **registering** Interop methods;
- **discover applications which offer methods**;
- **invoke** (call) registered Interop methods;
- **stream and subscribe to real-time data** using the Interop Streaming API;

We call applications which offer methods and streams *Interop servers*, and applications which consume them - *Interop clients*, and collectively - **Interop instances**.

*For detailed information on the Interop API (methods, streams, discovery and more), see the [**Interop**](../../../glue42-concepts/data-sharing-between-apps/interop/javascript/index.html) documentation.*
