## Window Management

Using the [Window Management API](../../../reference/core/latest/windows/index.html), your application can easily open and manipulate browser windows. This allows you to transform your traditional single-window web app into a multi-window native-like PWA application. The Window Management API enables applications to:

- **open multiple windows**;
- **manipulate the position and size** of opened windows;
- **pass context data upon opening new windows**;
- **listen for and handle events** related to opening and closing windows;
- **automatically save and restore** the positions and contexts of your application windows;

*For detailed information on the Window Management API, see the [**Window Management**](../../../glue42-concepts/windows/window-management/javascript/index.html) documentation.*
